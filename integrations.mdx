## Data Mapping and Synchronization

Customize how data maps from your CRM to RevTrack commission rules. Sync happens every 15 minutes or on webhooks for real-time updates.

|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|--------------|
| Opportunity Amount | commission_amount | Sale value for calculation   | Bi-directional |
| Close Date         | payout_date       | Triggers commission accrual  | Pull-only    |
| Deal Stage         | status            | Filters qualified deals      | Pull-only    |
| Payment Status     | paid              | Confirms revenue recognition | Webhook      |

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Connection Fails - Invalid Credentials" default-open="true">
    Verify your `client_id` and `client_secret`. Regenerate if expired. Check RevTrack logs for error codes like `invalid_grant`.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Data Not Syncing">
    Confirm field mappings match exactly (case-sensitive). Test with a single record. Increase sync interval to 1h if rate-limited.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Duplicate Records">
    Enable deduplication in RevTrack settings using `deal_id` or `opportunity_id` as unique keys.
  </Expandable>
